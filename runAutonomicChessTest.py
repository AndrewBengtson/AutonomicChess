#this script will be used in order to run tests on the autonomic chess system

#hardcode the "optimal" engine as well as the test engine's paths

#for loop in which monte-carlos will be run

    #initialize an empty board
    #initialiaze the autonomic manager
    #draw an opponent from the test set

    #while the game is incomplete
        #if odd numbered turn let opponent play
            #simply use the engine.play command

        #if even numbered turn let autonomic play
            #use the makeNextMove command
        
        #log anything we'd want to keep on a turn-by-turn basis

    #log who won, and the state the autonomic manager was in
